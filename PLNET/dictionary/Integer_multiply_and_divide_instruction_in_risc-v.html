<h1><span class="badge badge-primary">integer multiply and divide instruction in RISC-V</span></h1>
<div class="container-fluid">
<pre id="word_content" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">* Multiply 
    * General Form: MUL     RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: MUL     x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9*x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is multiplied by the contents of Reg2 and the result is placed in RegD.
    * RV32 / RV64 / RV128: Regardless of the size of the registers, the result of their multiplication will be twice as large, and therefore require 2 registers to contain. This instruction captures the lower-order half of the result and moves it into the destination register. See the commentary and the other multiply instructions for the upper half. 
    * Comments: There is no distinction between signed and unsigned; the result is identical. Over2low is ignored.  
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Multiply – High Bits (Signed) 
    * General Form: MULH    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: MULH    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = HighBits(x9*x13)
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is multiplied by the contents of Reg2 and the most-signi2icant half of the result is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are interpreted as signed values. 
    * Encoding: This is a R-type instruction. 
* Multiply – High Bits (Unsigned) 
    * General Form: MULHU   RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: MULHU   x4,x9,x13     # x4 = HighBits(x9*x13)
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is multiplied by the contents of Reg2 and the most-signi2icant half of the result is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are interpreted as unsigned values. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Multiply – High Bits (Signed and Unsigned) 
    * General Form: MULHSU  RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: MULHSU  x4,x9,x13     # x4 = HighBits(x9*x13)
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is multiplied by the contents of Reg2 and the most-signi2icant half of the result is placed in RegD. One operand is interpreted as signed and one operand is interpreted as unsigned and the result is interpreted as a signed value. The spec suggests that: Reg2 = multiplier = signed Reg1 = multiplicand = unsigned but this interpretation is also a possibility ??? Reg2 = multiplier = unsigned Reg1= multiplicand = signed 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction.
* Multiply Word 
    * General Form: MULW    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: MULW    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9*x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is multiplied by the contents of Reg2 and the result is placed in RegD. Only the lower order 32-bits of the result are used; the lower 32 bits are signed extended to the full length of the register. 
    * Comment: This instruction is used to properly emulate 32-bit multiplication on a 64-bit or 128-bit machine. Note that only the least-signi2icant 32 bits of Reg1 and Reg2 can possibly affect the result. If you want the upper 32-bits of the full 64-bit result use the MUL instruction on a 64-bit machine. 
    * RV32/RV64/RV128: This instruction is only available on 64-bit and 128-bit machines. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Divide (Signed) 
    * General Form: DIV     RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: DIV     x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9 DIV x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is divided by the contents of Reg2 and the quotient is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are signed values. 
    * Comments: Divide-by-zero and division-over2low result in mathematically incorrect results. See discussion above. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Divide (Unsigned) 
    * General Form: DIVU    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: DIVU    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9 DIV x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is divided by the contents of Reg2 and the quotient is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are unsigned values. 
    * Comments: Divide-by-zero produces a mathematically incorrect result. Division-over2low cannot occur. See discussion above. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Remainder (Signed) 
    * General Form: REM     RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: REM     x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9 REM x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is divided by the contents of Reg2 and the remainder is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are signed values. 
    * Comments: Divide-by-zero and division-over2low result in mathematically incorrect results. See discussion above. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction.
* Remainder (Unsigned) 
    * General Form: REMU    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: REMU    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9 REM x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is divided by the contents of Reg2 and the remainder is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are unsigned values.

    * General Form: DIVW    RegD,Reg1,Reg2

    * RV32/RV64/RV128: This instruction is only available on 64-bit and 128-bit machines. 
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is divided by the contents of Reg2 and the quotient is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are signed values. Only the low-order 32 bits of the operands are used and the 32-bit result is signed-extended to 2ill the destination register. 
    * Comments: Divide-by-zero and division-over2low result in mathematically incorrect results. See discussion above. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Divide Word (Unsigned) 
    * General Form: DIVUW   RegD,Reg1,Reg2

    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is divided by the contents of Reg2 and the quotient is placed in RegD. Both operands and the result are unsigned values. Only the low-order 32 bits of the operands are used and the 32-bit result is signed-extended (???) to 2ill the destination register.
