    * RV32 / RV64 / RV128: This instruction is only present in 64-bit and 128-bit machines. The operation is performed using 32-bit arithmetic.
    * Comments: There is no distinction between signed and unsigned. Overflow beyond 32-bits is ignored. The 32-bit result is sign-extended to fill the upper bits of the destination register. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Add Double 
    * General Form: ADDD    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: ADDD    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9+x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg1 is added to the contents of Reg2 and the result is placed in RegD. 
    * RV32 / RV64 / RV128: This instruction is only present in 128-bit machines. The operation is performed using 64-bit arithmetic. 
    * Comments:There is no distinction between signed and unsigned. Overflow beyond 64-bits is ignored. The 64-bit result is sign-extended to fill the upper bits of the destination register. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction.
* Subtract 
    * General Form: SUB    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: SUB    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9-x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg2 is subtracted from the contents of Reg1 and the result is placed in RegD. 
    * Comments: There is no distinction between signed and unsigned. Overflow is ignored. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction.
* Subtract Word 
    * General Form: SUBW    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: SUBW    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9-x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg2 is subtracted from the contents of Reg1 and the result is placed in RegD. 
    * RV32 / RV64 / RV128: This instruction is only present in 64-bit and 128-bit machines. The operation is performed using 32-bit arithmetic.
    * Comments: There is no distinction between signed and unsigned. Overflow beyond 32-bits is ignored. The 32-bit result is sign-extended to fill the upper bits of the destination register. 
    * Encoding:  This is an R-type instruction. 
* Subtract Double 
    * General Form: SUBD    RegD,Reg1,Reg2
    * Example: SUBD    x4,x9,x13     # x4 = x9-x13
    * Description: The contents of Reg2 is subtracted from the contents of Reg1 and the result is placed in RegD. 
    * RV32 / RV64 / RV128: This instruction is only present in 128-bit machines. The operation is performed using 64-bit arithmetic.

    * Description: This instruction is only available for 64-bit and 128-bit machines. 
The value in the lower 32 bits of Reg1 is signed-extended to 64 or 128 bits and placed in RegD. 
    * Comments: This instruction is useful when a 32-bit signed value must be “coerced” to a larger value on 64-bit and 128-bit machine.

ADDIW   RegD,Reg1,0
* Sign Extend Doubleword to Quadword

    * Encoding: This is a special case of a more general instruction. This instruction is assembled identically to: 
ADDID   RegD,Reg1,0
* Negate 
    * General Form: NEG    RegD,Reg2
    * Example: NEG    x4,x9        # x4 = -x9
    * Description: The contents of Reg2 is arithmetically negated and the result is placed in RegD. 
    * Comments: The result is computed by subtraction from zero. Overflow can only occur when the most negative value is negated. Overflow is ignored. 
    * Encoding: This is a special case of a more general instruction. This instruction is assembled identically to: 
SUB   RegD,x0,Reg2
* Negate Word 
    * General Form: NEGW    RegD,Reg2
    * Example: NEGW    x4,x9        # x4 = -x9
    * Description: The contents of Reg2 is arithmetically negated and the result is placed in RegD.  
    * RV64 / RV 128: This instruction is only present in 64-bit and 128-bit machines. The operation is performed using 32-bit arithmetic, whereas the NEG instruction operates on 64-bit or 128-bit quantities in the larger machines. 
    * Encoding: This is a special case of a more general instruction. This instruction is assembled identically to: 
SUBW   RegD,x0,Reg2
* Negate Doubleword 
    * General Form: NEGD    RegD,Reg2
